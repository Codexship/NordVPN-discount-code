## Current NordVPN Deals (June 2025)
If you're ready to lock down your digital privacy without paying full price, NordVPN is serving up some sweet deals this month. Here’s what’s on the table:

2-Year Plan – Up to 76% Off + 3 Months Free
Grab the 2-year subscription and pay as little as $3.09/month. On top of that, you’ll get 3 extra months completely free and even a bonus eSIM for mobile data. Compared to monthly billing, this saves you up to $250. But heads up — this one’s only around until early July.

If you’re a student or work in healthcare, you can score an extra 15% off. Just verify your status through a student or professional discount platform and enjoy the extra savings.

Referral Program – 3 Months Free
Know someone who could use a VPN too? Refer them to NordVPN and you’ll both get 3 bonus months for free. Share a link, save together.

Heads up: All plans come with a 30-day money-back guarantee. So if you change your mind, you’re covered.

Exclusive Discount Codes from Influencers
Let’s be real — influencer codes aren’t just hype. They’re one of the most consistent ways to unlock NordVPN’s best deals, especially if you know where to look.

If you follow big YouTubers or podcast hosts, you’ve probably heard them mention NordVPN in their sponsorship spots. But what they don’t always tell you is that their links often come with special perks — discounts you won’t always see on NordVPN’s homepage.

Here are a few influencer codes that are actually worth your time:

WIRED – Trusted tech publication and frequent NordVPN partner. Their code usually gets you up to 74% off plus 3 bonus months on the 2-year plan.

internethistorian – Known for hilarious deep dives on internet culture, his NordVPN shoutouts come with some of the biggest savings.

PewDiePie, MrBeast Gaming, Casey Neistat, Philip DeFranco, and even niche creators across fitness, travel, and gaming often drop their codes during videos or in descriptions.

These deals are typically auto-applied when you click through their personalized links — meaning no typing, no hunting for codes. Just check that the discount shows up at checkout before you hit pay.

Also, here’s a pro tip: influencer codes tend to stick around for months, but they can change without notice. If you spot one that works and the price looks right, don’t wait too long — those “limited-time” offers? Sometimes they actually mean it.


Additional Ways to Save on NordVPN
Even if you miss out on an influencer code or seasonal sale, there are still a few clever ways to shave even more off your NordVPN subscription. Here’s how:

1. Student and Youth Discounts
If you’re in school or under a certain age, you might qualify for extra savings. NordVPN partners with platforms like Student Beans or Youth Discount to offer verified users an additional 15% off. All you have to do is prove your status — usually with a school email or ID upload — and you’re in.

2. Referral Program
Already a NordVPN user? Share your referral link with a friend and both of you get rewarded. Every successful sign-up through your link earns you 3 months of free service. Stack a few referrals and you could be covered for nearly a year — without paying a dime.

3. Holiday and Seasonal Promotions
NordVPN is famous for rolling out aggressive deals during major sale events. Black Friday, Cyber Monday, New Year, and even back-to-school season — these are all prime times to snag the steepest discounts. If you’re not in a rush, it might be worth waiting for the next big sale to drop.

4. Longer-Term Plans = Bigger Discounts
The more months you commit to, the less you’ll pay per month. That’s not just a sales tactic — it’s built into their pricing. If you’re serious about online privacy and plan to use a VPN long-term, go for the 2-year plan. You’ll get the best rate, plus bonus months or extras like a free password manager or malware protection add-ons.
